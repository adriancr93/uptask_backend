## What is MERN?

**MERN** stands for **MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js**.

A stack is a set of tools to build an app.

**Full Stack** means you can create the complete stack of an app, and the MERN Stack lets you do this, just like the PERN Stack.

Our backend uses Node with Express, but other options include Nest.js and Fastify.

## What is MongoDB?

A NoSQL database oriented to documents and large amounts of data.

Data is stored in a format similar to JSON (documents) called BSON.

Tables are called **Collections** and records are called **Documents**.

## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases.

NoSQL databases are designed for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications.

These types of databases are common when there are a large number of read/write transactions and when data is not uniform or related.
